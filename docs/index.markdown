I am a doctoral researcher in natural language processing at the [AI Research Group](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/ai-research-group/) at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK, investigating state-of-the-art approaches to automated claim detection and fact verification. Having recently submitted my thesis, titled _"Automated Fact-checking for Supporting Sub-editing"_, I'm currently waiting for my viva for the completion of my degree. 

Since 2018, I have worked part time at [CASM Technology](https://www.casmtechnology.com/) as a researcher/data scientist/software developer. At CASM, I've tackled a number of interesting and challenging projects, chiefly among them the application of my PhD research, collaborating with industry experts to develop proof-of-concept applications to assist human fact-checkers. This work has been tested live in the newsroom of a leading UK newspaper publisher. 

At CASM, I have also worked on multiple projects involving the detection of harmful discourse and disinformation in social media text, combining the experience of domain experts and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to build data collection and analysis pipelines allowing the large-scale analysis of cross-platform text. 

Before becoming involved in NLP, I worked for several years as a software developer, usually building and supporting reporting applications, dashboards and other business intelligence tools.

In 2018, I received an MSc in Data Science from the University of Sussex, and I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Tecnologico de Reynosa, in Reynosa, Mexico.
