## Professional Experience
### Researcher | [CASM Technology](https://www.casmtechnology.com/) | September 2018 - Present
* Developed state-of-the-art transformer-based models for the identification of claims requiring verification in journalistic articles, and for automating the collection and ranking of evidence required for the verification of such claims. These were used to develop proof-of-concept applications used in the newsroom of a leading UK newspaper publisher.
* Collaborated with domain experts to perform cross-platform analysis of social media text at a large scale. This involved the development of models for the automated detection of harmful discourse such as extremism, hate speech, and disinformation in social media text.
* Developed data collection and analysis workflows that integrated data from a variety of sources, such as different social media platforms and web scraping, enabling the use of cross-platform analysis approaches.
* Developed tools that enabled data collection from new and emerging social media networks, including distributed and blockchain-based platforms.

### Programmer Analyst II | [Sanmina](https://www.sanmina.com/) / [42Q](https://www.42-q.com/) | September 2013 – July 2017
* Developed a new version of the company’s reporting application, used in manufacturing sites worldwide, to move into a new cloud-based architecture, in the process working with a multidisciplinary team to achieve this goal without negatively affecting company performance.
